      title: "Custom Wedding Neon Sign", 
      description: 
      `
        ‚ô• This beautifully neon sign is perfect for your special day ‚ô•

        - Better Together LED Neon Sign in your choice of color -
    
        Traditional neon is made out of glass that is bent to create its shape. LED neon is made out of flexible LED lights that are encased in a PVC jacket. While both pieces glow, LED neon is durable, cost-effective and an energy-efficient alternative to the classic glass neon that we all love. If used correctly our neon range should last 50,000+hrs
    
        ‚ô• MADE FROM
        13mm Flexible LED tubing mounted onto a 4mm acrylic backing.
        Our Neons are made to suit the purchasing countries' voltage and plug style and will come with your local plug type.
    
        ‚ô• DIMENSIONS:
        This neon sign measures: 31.5" x 31" (800mm x 780mm) making it a nice large centerpiece for your special day.
    
        ‚ô• LEAD TIME
        - Please allow up to 4-6 weeks for production time and shipping as this product is made to order.
    
        ‚ô• WHAT'S INCLUDED?
        Neon Sign Customized to Your Specifications
        Power Supply and Adaptor
        Dimmer Switch
        Drill holes for installation
    
        ‚ô• NOTES:
        - Listing image is in our warm white colour.
        - Our LED neon is handmade by bending material into shapes. The nature of this process means that there are some bends, curves and sizes we just can‚Äôt make.
        We‚Äôll let you know when we run into this with your design!
    
        ‚ô• INSTALLING MY NEON
        Our Neons are surprisingly light and on average weigh 6-10lbs (3-5kg)
        They come with pre-drilled holes in the acrylic backing for easy hanging.
    
        Hang your neon with hooks; wire or heavy-duty removable hooks.
    
        Suitable hanging methods:
        - Fishing wire (knotted with fisherman‚Äôs knots)
        - Thin wire
        - Hooks
        - Rope (correctly knotted)
        - 3m heavy-duty removable hooks (available from your local hardware store)
    
        ‚ô• LIGHTING UP MY NEON
        Lighting up your neon is easy! Our Neons plug into the wall and do not come with a battery pack (for very small neons we can offer a battery pack).
        Your custom neon order will include:
        1 x Clear cord 1-2 metres attached to the sign (depending on the size of the sign)
        1 x Adaptor + Transformer (compatible with your country) with a 1-2 meter cord, which connects to the clear cord and plugs into the wall.

        - HANDCRAFTED IN CHARLOTTE, NORTH CAROLINA, USA.
        - ALL-NATURAL SOY WAX.
        - 100% COTTON WICK.
        - ECO-FRIENDLY & SUSTAINABLE WAX ONLY.
        - PHTHALATE-FREE, PARAFFIN-FREE.
        Burn in increments of 4 hours for best results. Trim wicks to 1/4" before each use.
        Please also be advised "frosting" may occur and this is not a fault in the candle. This is a natural effect of using soy wax and does not, in any way, impact the performance of your candle.
        Due to the design of our candle, we recommend placing the candle on top of a dish or plate to prevent wax from coming in contact with your surfaces.
        Because all candles are 100 percent handmade, each candle will have minor imperfections by nature and color may slightly vary.
        For irregular shaped candles, we cannot guarantee that each one will be fully burned.
