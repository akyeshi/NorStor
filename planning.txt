-------- app feature design flow: 

React: 
  • define model, seed data 
  • define functional component, create states for needed data using react hook i.e. useState
  • define AJAX/fetch requests in utility modules to CRUD data in the backend 

Express 
  • define routes matching frontend api request path url 
  • define controller action/function on the api endpoint that works with DB directly and get the data back to the frontend via res.json(data) 

React: 
  • resolve async/awaited data from the backend into data 
  • update data state with 'useState' react hook 
  • render data into the component 
      i.e. const getAllPosts = async () => {
              const allPosts = await postsAPI.getAll();
              setPosts(allPosts); 
            }


--- 
1. create the ERD diagram (draw document-level models for data entities and their relationship)
2. follow the design flow above to get 'products' feature 'getAllProducts' components rendered with data
